# bencodes-blog

This is a Blog Engine built using Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, MySQL, Spring Security, and Bootstrap. 

The goal was to build a complete blogging system from the ground up and eventually launch it on AWS. It is still a work in progress. 

As of 11/21/17 I am currently working on integrating Spring Security and the ability to register/login as an admin
to make blog posts.
